Used this to generate a new project.  

In terminal ran
    create-react-app tic-tac-toe

Success! Created tic-tac-toe at /Users/stevebaker/Documents/projects/javascriptProjects/react-projects/tic-tac-toe
Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

  yarn start
    Starts the development server.

  yarn build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  yarn test
    Starts the test runner.

  yarn eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you can’t go back!

  cd tic-tac-toe
