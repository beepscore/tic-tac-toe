# Appendix- create-react-app
Used this to generate a new project.

In terminal ran

Success! Created tic-tac-toe at /Users/stevebaker/Documents/projects/javascriptProjects/react-projects/tic-tac-toe
Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

  yarn start

  yarn build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd tic-tac-toe
  yarn start
